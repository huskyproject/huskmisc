Sorry, no docs available yet. I hope the following notes are helpful.

Format of templates:
conditionals: ?<check>?<consequent>?<alternative>?
check: <varName><comparison><value>
comparison: One of "<=", ">=", "=", "<", ">"

variable expansion: $<variableName>[:format]$
where format is a printf-like format string without leading % and without
conversion specifier (template variables are always strings).

filename	direntry	name of current file
filedesc	direntry	description of current file
filesize	direntry	size of current file
fileexist	direntry	does the file really exist? "yes"/"no"
fileyear	direntry        modification time of file: year
filemonth	direntry        modification time of file: month
fileday		direntry        modification time of file: day
areaname	area*, dir*	name of current area
